How many words of exactly six letters, each containing a consecutive doubled letter, can you find in the hexagonal grid at the right? (See http://aykut.scripts.mit.edu/blog/ for the grid ) Words must be spelled sequentially by following the lines connecting the circles. For example, you can spell BOTTLE by starting at the B in the upper left, proceeding down to the O, up and back to the T, doubling the T, then moving to the right to the L and E. You cannot spell HOTTER in the grid, because no line connects the T to the E. You may return to a letter and use it twice in the same word — but that does not count as doubling. Thus, OCELOT would not be acceptable, because it does not contain a doubled letter. Plurals are fine. Proper names, hyphenated words and words appearing only as parts of phrases are prohibited. Finding 20 words is good; 35 is genius level. Our source for acceptable answers is Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition. We found 37 relatively familiar answers and seven unusual or not-so-common ones, as well as one word we consider familiar that is not in the dictionary. Our answer list will be shown next week.
